Version 1.9 

Additions

Added plotting feature


Fixes

Unit defaults will only be changed when Suffix = 0.  This makes it much easier to take a shot, change its ID, change its suffix, and then carry on after this with what would have been normally the next number.  This is important for closing buckets.

Fixed annoying bug wherein you had to click away and then click back to first field in the edit list to actually get the menu to activate.

Verison 1.10

Additions
Add Leica-Geo for newer Leica total station that only support the GeoCOM format.
